Alright! 2 years.

&nbsp;
I still feel new at Elastic sometimes. 
So, let me walk you through my experience working at Elastic.

Being a developer myself, I always dreamt of helping developers with right set of tools. And with Elastic, that's a dream come true. I never thought I'd work for this awesome organization. 

Story begins around July, 2017. My now colleague, then acquaintance referred me at Elastic which was quite unknown to me except for the product. 

Long story, short! I joined Elastic exactly on November 28, 2017. 

### The beginning

Elastic is an amazing place to work at. It isn't just about benefits, pay or perks. It is because of several amazing humans, that I love to work here. 

One of my managers often said, any place isn't great to work if you don't feel enthusiastic about going to office and check for mails every morning.
At Elastic, everyday, over last few years, I feel amazed going(starting) to work. It is indeed amazing to see the opportunity to create an impact, help people and still understand there is a room for improvement.

### Work Culture

In my view, Elastic has unparallel work culture. Something that is working out very well.

During the interview process I got to know that I need to work alone, individually and help build community. I have done `Work from Home` at my previous stints but not so extensive like this. 

Now I feel more productive working from. And also saving myself from #BangaloreTraffic.

Elastic is a distributed workplace with lot of engineers working from home without seeing each other for about 6 months. But when we meet, we endlessly discuss about work, life and many more.

Open culture is new to me. It is overwhelming in a way and took time for me to comprehend information. Senior leaders are very approachable. Your opinion is valued. 

As soon as I joined, I went to Tokyo for a meeting. Someone looked very familiar, but I quickly couldn't recollect who he was. He was wearing a black hoodie and holding a coffee mug. I had this wonderful opportunity of having a chat for the first time with **Shay Banon**, creator of Elasticsearch and Founder of Elastic.co. He is an thought provoking person.

**Shay** does AMA's internally, in one such he mentioned that `Work is part of Life` but it is not a 50-50 balance you need to maintain. It is ok and important at times to be flexible. 

At Elastic, everyone is given their choice of working style, provided you respect everyone's time and join meetings. You're never asked or mandated to work beyond working hours. My work is divided in chunks. At times `It, Depends` on various factors because I might be travelling. 

It is divided into 2-2-3-2. Work for 2 hours in the morning, break for breakfast, again work for 2 hours, then lunch, a continuous block of 3 hours, followed by a snack break and 2 hours. 

Elastic is an extremely collaborative space. There is a ton of opportunity to work and learn from others. I have learned a lot working with several Sales leaders as well as Customers. 

### The Work itself

Due to the kind of role I play, I travel very often. Being in this company gave me opportunity to interact with developers, Senior Leaders, Business stalwarts.

I spoke at 250+ developer events which included Conferences, Meetups, Panel discussions, Workshops, Interviews. Elastic's technology is so powerful in helping developers build many useful applications. Be it for a dating app, security  or a healthcare application.

I work with several affinity community groups, Elastic User Groups, Cloud Partners and Educational Institutions in India and South East Asia. 

BTW, I could do some of these because of our amazing Program Managers in the Community Programmes Team. They help connect Advocates and curates what community needs. 

Community is thought as an important area and we have many programmes through which I feel elated to participate in.

### Elastic Cares

Elastic has a specific programme to match up 1% of your salary to various Charities via a tool called Benevity. You can also make a donation and then match it later. 

### The Cons

Well, there are somethings we are getting better at. Elastic is growing tremendously and some processes don't scale. We are working on several initiatives. We also have amazing HR team who help us in many ways. 

### Finally

Lastly..In my view, we should never stop learning or stop taking challenging work. Elastic is a such a place where you're surrounded by smart and innovative people, you'd only feel ok at any point of time. 

Be it Work, Colleagues, Management or the Technology.. Elastic is a wonderful place to work.
